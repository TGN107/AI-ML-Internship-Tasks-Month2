Support tickets are typically free-text entries describing issues, queries, or requests made by users. Manually tagging these tickets is time-consuming, and an efficient automated system can significantly reduce human intervention. This task involves leveraging **zero-shot**, **fine-tuned**, and **few-shot learning** techniques to classify tickets into relevant categories with a high degree of accuracy.\n"

By including specific labeled instances—such as mapping a Wi-Fi issue to a \"Network problem\"—the code moves beyond simple instructions and uses in-context learning to show the model exactly how to format the output (the Top 3 ranking) and how to handle the ticket logic. This method acts as a middle ground between no training and full fine-tuning, utilizing the prompt itself to prime the model's weights for a specific response style while retaining the use_cache=False safety measure to ensure stable generation."

It’s like showing a new employee a couple of correctly filed folders; they immediately get the \"vibe\" of the job much better than if they just read a manual. However, that 0% for Fine-Tuning is a total \"technical glitch\" moment. It doesn't mean the model is stupid; it actually means the AI is likely giving the right answers but in a format the evaluation code doesn't recognize (like we saw earlier when it was repeating the instructions instead of just the tag). It’s essentially \"speaking the wrong language\" during the test, so even if its logic is perfect, the scorecard is marking it as a fail because the words don't match the key exactly."

        "The objective of this task is to build an **automated support ticket tagging system** using a **Large Language Model (LLM)** that can accurately classify free-text customer support tickets into predefined categories. The task focuses on evaluating and comparing different LLM-based learning strategies to improve classification performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, the objectives are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Automatically assign **relevant tags** to free-text support tickets from a predefined category list.\n",
        "* Evaluate **zero-shot classification**, where the LLM performs tagging without any task-specific training.\n",
        "* Apply **few-shot learning**, providing a small number of labeled examples to improve prediction accuracy.\n",
        "* Perform **fine-tuning** on a labeled support ticket dataset to create a domain-specialized model.\n",
        "* Generate and rank the **Top 3 most probable tags** for each ticket instead of a single-label output.\n",
        "* Compare the effectiveness of zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned approaches.\n",
